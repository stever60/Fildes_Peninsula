Title

Updates to reconstructed temperature and tephra deposit age data from Yanou Lake, Fildes Peninsula, South Shetland Islands, northern Antarctic Peninsula.

Abstract

The dataset comprises of updated reconstructed temperature and tephra deposits age data from Yanou Lake, Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, South Shetland Islands. Updates of data originally published in Roberts et al. (2017) to the 2020 radiocarbon calibration curves and the Antarctic and global glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipid biomarker temperature calibration are included. The updated GDGT MSAT (mean summer air temperature) data was obtained by recalibrating the Pearson et al. (2011) global and Foster et al. (2016) Antarctic lake surface GDGT MSAT datasets.

Lineage/methodology

Yanou Lake data

Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) analysis of freshwater-brackish sediments from Yanou Lake dating to c. 6 ka was used to reconstruct mean summer air temperature (MSAT) and MSAT anomaly profiles (relative to the pre-industrial mean 1–0.25 cal. ka BP; RMSE = 2.45 °C; Pearson et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2017). The published GDGT palaeotemperature reconstructions for Yanou Lake in Roberts et al. (2017) overestimated MSAT for data older than 2000 years due to a lack of data at the upper end of the Foster et al. (2016) Antarctic calibration dataset. Therefore, we constructed a new MSAT anomaly profile by combining GDGT-MSAT data from the global (Pearson et al., 2011) and Antarctic (Foster et al., 2016) GDGT calibration datasets and applied a new regression model based on the same compounds used in both (Juggins pers. comm). This produced a revised mean MSAT anomaly of 0.06±1.50 °C for the last 6,000 years of the Yanou Lake record, which is of a similar magnitude to the James Ross Island ice core mean annual temperature anomaly of 0.01±0.35 °C in the same period.

Revised modelled ages for tephra deposits in the Yanou Lake record were produced using 2020 calibration curves and Bayesian age-depth modelling in BACON v. 2.5 in R (Blaauw and Christen, 2011).
